## Project description

This is the independent work for the GitHub workshop during Fall 2024
semester. I am following the instructions found in the Code folder.

## Repository contents

There are three folders: Code, Data, and Figures. In the Code folder,
you can find the instructions for this workshop, and the scripts for
generating the code and analysis.

In the Data folder, you can find the generated data.

In the Figures folder, you can find the generated figures.

Finally, there is a Results folder containing the results.

## How to contribute

Ideally this is an independent project with no need for contribution.
